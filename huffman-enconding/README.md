# Huffman algorithm 


Huffaman is an algorithm that is used to compress data. It uses a table showing how often each character occurs (its frequency) to  build up an optimal representation as a binary string. 

#Option of how to represent: 
  1. Binart character code: Every character has a unique binary representation
     . fixed-length code
     . variable-length code ( preferred because it uses less bits)

# Time complexity: O(nlgn)
